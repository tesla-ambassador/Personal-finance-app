## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all of the personal finance app data at-a-glance on the overview page
- View all transactions on the transactions page with pagination for every ten transactions
- Search, sort, and filter transactions
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) budgets and saving pots
- View the latest three transactions for each budget category created
- View progress towards each pot
- Add money to and withdraw money from pots
- View recurring bills and the status of each for the current month
- Search and sort recurring bills
- Receive validation messages if required form fields aren't completed
- Navigate the whole app and perform all actions using only their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)

Note: At the time of writing, I didn't implement the bonus features. However, I plan to add them when I add the database and authentication features.

## My process
Buckle up! This was a very fun project to work on. I had lots of ups and downs but I learned a lot! I feel like I only want to take on more challenging projects like this moving forward.
If you look through my code, you will find that it's both poorly written and well-written.ðŸ˜‚ There were times I was just too tired after working my day job and then trying to fix bugs that seemed impossible to find.
Anyways, I managed to get this done within a month. That's cause I had to split my time between work and this project. I haven't yet implemented a backend but I plan on doing so after taking on a few more projects like this to cement what I've learned.

### Built with

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui
- Recharts
- Vitest
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) - React library for state management
- [React-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React library for form validation
- [Tanstack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest) - React library for data tables and datagrids

### What I learned
I learned a bunch of things. I should have documented this while I was developing the app because I seem to have forgotten most of my highlights but among the most notable ones are that I learned how to use Tanstack Table to create a data grid.
That was mostly for the transactions page and the recurring bills page. It was a bit of a pain to implement some of the functions but I had to repeat writing the code multiple times until it stuck.
I also had a little more time with react-hook-form. I feel like I'm a lot more comfortable with it now and I'm looking forward to using it in more projects.
I learned how to use Clsx and a lot more capabilities of Tailwind Css.
News Flash! Did you know that `next/router` is deprecated! Funny how these frameworks are always changing.

I would also like to express my deep sadness for the deprecation of Material Themes in VS Code. I couldn't find a replacement to get themes that I'd be comfortable with and therefore, I have migrated to Zed.
Zed is great! I'm trying to get comfortable with it but I know It'll do just fine! I look forward to giving you guys a review of it.

Much as I would love to rant, I'm tired rn... I haven't slept in a bit so I'll just wrap this up and write more when I implement a backend!
**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development
I'm going to add authentication and connect to a database so that It's a lot more usable and also when you refresh, my zustand persistence is a bit shaky in that you are able to see the default data for a second or two.
I noticed a lot of bugs and I tried to fix the ones that I found. If you find any, please feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request.


### Useful resources

Read documentations of the tools I stated above
Also, you can use AI (Claude) to help explain things to you (NOT to copy and paste code). Cause I found the solutions on stack-overflow either too old or just not directly applicable to my problem.
